This repository contains the scripts for our textmodels. The underlying dataset of press releases is not published here.

### Supervised learning aggregated

We calculate a Multinomial Naive Bayes text classification model and then aggregate the number of press releases per issue by quarter. In order to get a relative measure of issue attention for each party, we divide the number of issue-specific press releases by the total number of press releases by that party in each quarter.

*Issue attention of the CDU/CSU (Germany) to issue "7 - Environment & Energy"*
