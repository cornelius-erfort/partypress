Political parties emphasize different issues in their public communication efforts to address the topics of the day and to strengthen their policy profiles.

### Supervised learning aggregated

We calculate a Multinomial Naive Bayes text classification model and then aggregate the number of press releases per issue by quarter. In order to get a relative measure of issue attention for each party, we divide the number of issue-specific press releases by the total number of press releases by that party in each quarter.
