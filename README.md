# Measuring parties issue agendas (SCRIPTS)

Political parties emphasize different issues in their public communication efforts to address the topics of the day and to strengthen their policy profiles. Here, we develop and evaluate models to automatically classify parties' press releases into issue categories to dynamically measure issue attention.

This repository contains the scripts where we build and evaluate our text models.

The entire dataset of press releases is not published here.


The following figure shows an example for the measurement of the immigration agendas of German parties.
